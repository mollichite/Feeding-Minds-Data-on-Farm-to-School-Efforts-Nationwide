# Feeding Minds: Data on Farm to School Efforts Nationwide

This project provides an assessment of the USDA’s Farm to School Programs with a focus on participation level, how "local" is defined and geographic distribution accross the US.  


# Conculsions

Visual #1: 24.3% of participants define "local" as "Produced Within the State".  Visual #2: The top 10 participating states in the Farm to School census: NC, NV, VA, WI, CO, OR, GA, UT, KS, SC with the weighted participation rate relative to overall number of schools in that state.  Visualization #3: States like TX, CA, OH, PA, MI, NY, IL, WI, MN and NJ would potenitally increase their participation in Farm to School programs if funding increased.
